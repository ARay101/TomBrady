Once his timeout was over, he helped the team win Super Bowl 51 in overtime. <br><br>
        In 2017 and 2018, he lost and won Super Bowls 51 and 52. In 2019, his last year as a <a class="Pats">Patriot</a>, he lost the wild card game. He did not resign with the <a class="Pats">Patriots</a>, and eventually signed with the <a class="Bucs">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. <br>
